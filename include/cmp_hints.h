/*
 * KCOV comparison operand hint pool.
 *
 * When running in KCOV_TRACE_CMP mode, the kernel records every
 * comparison instruction with its operands. We extract constants
 * the kernel compares against and store them per-syscall-number.
 * During argument generation, we sometimes substitute a learned
 * constant instead of a random value, dramatically improving the
 * fuzzer's ability to pass kernel validation checks.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by (cmp_ip, value, size) -- a single comparison
 * site that exercises both small and large operand widths is two
 * distinct hints, and the same constant compared at two different
 * kernel PCs is two distinct hints.  Precision over robustness: a
 * kernel rebuild that shuffles addresses invalidates the IP keys,
 * but the kallsyms fingerprint on the persisted file catches that
 * and forces a cold start.
