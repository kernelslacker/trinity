# childops/mm/ — Memory-Management Childops

Scripted VM/memory stress workloads: mapping lifecycle, protection-boundary splits, madvise patterns, memory locking, NUMA migration, userfaultfd, and pagecache/vDSO edge cases. One workload per file, dispatched by symbol via `op_dispatch[]` in `child/child-altop-table.c`.
