# check-static

`make check-static` runs a battery of structural consistency checks
against the source tree.  It is the bridge between "the code compiled"
and "the code is internally consistent."  The checks are cheap (target
is single-digit seconds) and require no runtime execution beyond what
`make` already does.

Trinity's fuzzer binary cannot safely run on developer hosts; it only
runs on an isolated fuzz machine.  Architectural invariants that would
normally surface as a runtime assertion failure therefore have to be
caught earlier.  `check-static` is where that catching happens.

## Running

    make check-static

Each check prints one of:

    PASS: <check-name>                       (exit 0, counted)
    WARN: <check-name>: <message>            (exit 0, counted; tripwire)
    FAIL: <check-name>: <details on stderr>  (exit 1, counted)

The orchestrator exits 0 if every check passed (warnings allowed) or 1
if any check failed.  Detailed failure output goes to stderr.

## Skipping a check

    CHECK_STATIC_SKIP=childop-arrays,post-state-magic make check-static

Comma-separated list of check basenames (without `.sh`).

## Adding a check

Drop an executable shell script into `scripts/check-static/`.  The file
name (minus `.sh`) is the check name and what `CHECK_STATIC_SKIP`
matches against.  The script may rely on `$REPO_ROOT` (exported by the
orchestrator) to locate sources.  Conventions:

- Print exactly one `PASS:` / `WARN:` / `FAIL:` line on stdout.
- Emit detail on stderr.
- Return 0 on pass/warn, non-zero on fail.
- Keep runtime under one second; the whole battery should stay fast
  enough that contributors run it after every edit.

## What today's checks enforce

(See each script for the precise rule.)

- `childop-arrays`: arrays and dispatch tables indexed by
  `NR_CHILD_OP_TYPES` must have one entry per `enum child_op_type`
  value.
- `post-state-magic`: every `struct *_post_state` in `syscalls/` must
  begin with `unsigned long magic` and ship a matching
  `*_POST_STATE_MAGIC` constant -- the convention that prevented the
  ppoll bad-free regression class.  Grandfathered structs that predate
  the convention are listed in
  `scripts/check-static/post-state-magic.baseline`; that list should
  shrink over time, never grow.
- `syscall-metadata`: best-effort sanity on `struct syscallentry` --
  ARG_RANGE arguments must declare low/high bounds.
- `shared-region-budget`: tripwire that warns when the number of
  shared-region producer call sites approaches `MAX_SHARED_ALLOCS`.
  Silent under-protection is the bug class, not loud over-protection.
