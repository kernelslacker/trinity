/*
 * Cross-arg splice ratio.  With probability 1/SPLICE_RATIO, an arg in
 * a replay starts from a sibling arg's snapshot value rather than its
 * own, before the per-arg mutator chain runs on it.
 *
 * Why splice within the same syscall (rather than across syscalls or
 * across snapshots): args within one syscall invocation share semantic
 * structure — flags fields tend to share bit-encodings, length fields
 * tend to share scale, fd fields tend to be related — and splicing
 * preserves that structure while shuffling which slot each value lands
 * in.  Cross-snapshot or cross-syscall splice would mostly produce
 * type-incoherent gibberish; intra-syscall keeps the splice on a chain
 * of values the kernel already validated together.
 *
 * 10% is conservative: too much splice and we lose the per-arg
 * locality the corpus is meant to preserve.  Tunable here without
 * touching call sites.
